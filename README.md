# Welcome to Sonic Night Funkin' Plus Source Code!

## Hi, Arie "Herox" Temps here!
We were originally gonna do an executable mod without Source Code for v5, but as a coder myself (*Herox*), I did a lot for the mod for this and we ran into problems within' lua limitations and errors using `Psych Engine v1.0 Pre-release`. Some functions like "stopSound" wouldn't work in pre-release but it's Psych, what can I do?

However, when we discovered about doing **Source Code for SNF v5**:
* Lily and Herox have no knowledge about Source Code but we eventually did learn about more on GitHub.
* As Herox being a coder and others but not Haxe, I still decided to learn more to it of what I can do and what not.

`Nonetheless, I hope you enjoy your stay viewing this source code!`
